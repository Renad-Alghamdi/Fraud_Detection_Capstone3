### Welcome to "Fraud Detection Project".

We will implement Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Network algorithms and Unbalanced Data Techniques. Also visualize performances of the models using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and other libraries in a variety of ways.

Data drift and model drift are key concepts of ML and MLOPS, we can monitor and check your data and models with plenty of ways and tools. Deepchecks is one of them and the leading tool for testing and validating your machine learning models and data, and it enables doing so with minimal effort. In this project, we apply Data Integrity, Train-Test Validation, and Model Evaluation checks.
This project aims to predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent.
